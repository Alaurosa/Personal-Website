          I'm Ashley and I absolutely hated my name. In the eyes of Middle School me, Ashley was too boring, too common
          and I wanted to be unique. I thought that a unique name was associated with a unique personality, but this
          Ashley Kim is very different from other Ashley Kims. The <a
            href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/ashley-name-meaning-origin-popularity-5182489#:~:text=Ashley%20is%20derived%20from%20the,then%20as%20a%20given%20name.">origin
            of my name</a> is not only extremely rich, but its associated with a forest of ash trees. Not only do I love
          trees because they are peaceful, warm, and always there for you to lean on, but I also know that they
          represent <a href="https://onetreeplanted.org/">something taken for granted by humans</a>, something I felt
          that I did for my name. I hope to create video games that incorporate trees in some way or form because trees
          need a voice too.
          <br><br>
          To achieve the many dreams I have in the video game industry, I am pursuing game development. I've had a
          passion for video games since the WII and DS were prominent. This interest evolved into my involvement in PC
          games. Throughout high school, I was forced away from video games in the interest of my studies, so instead of
          giving up video games, I decided to make my own. This way, playing video games would be a byproduct of my
          interest in making them. Though my passion for video games and the creation of them runs deeper than the
          restrictions placed on me in high school. My interest started at an earlier age when I realized how important
          video games were to me and my interest in helping others. I have many ideas that I hope to implement, even
          without the resources or a true plan.
