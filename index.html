      <h2>A Little Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Ashley Kim and my dream is to be a coder when I grow up. I've always had a passion for playing video games and that evolved into making games. My end goal is to have enough knowledge to understand and create my own game. I absolutely love anything Asian because I am Asian! I come from both Korean and Chinese heritage, which means GREAT FOOD!
