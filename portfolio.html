          <h3 class="projectTitle">Team4Her</h3>
          <h4 class="appDescription"> Team4Her was a project I started working on last year, during the summer of my
            sophomore year. It was a project built for and during Technovation, a competition for apps and AI. A couple
            of friends and I got together and decided to build an app that could help solve a problem. Team4Her was an
            app built to help women and nonbinaries in STEM by providng them with more opportunities and better access
            to competitions such as Technovation. Not everyone has equal access to materials which puts them at an
            extreme disadvantage, so we are working to get rid of that. <br> Built with Flutter </h4>

          <h4 class="appDescription"> Simply Make was a project I also started summer of sophomore year. It was a
            project built for an entrepreneurship summer internship where we learned about building and marketing our
            product. Our app, Simply Make, was a project built for college students and busy adults that don't have time
            to go to the store to find ingredients for their recipes. They provide recipes based on the ingredients
            already in your fridge. <br> Built with Flutter </h4>

    <h4 class="websiteDescription">The Belugas is a website that I created for a discord server and youtube channel that
      my friends and I started. It's a pretty recent development, so it doesn't have all the features that I''m going to
      add, but its mostly a bunch of games and stats that we hold as a group. I also think I'm going to change the color
      scheme later.</h4>

      couple weeks ago, which is why there is almost nothing on the website. I am in the process of getting all the
      information together to get it ready</h4>

    <h4 class="websiteDescription">Website for the other club I am president of, MSJHS Paws. <br> Website for the blind
      with voice as the main form of communication <br> Website to advocate for my apps, including an application for
      older adults that don't know how to use a phone app to access their recipes online. I also wanted to provide an
      option to join a STEM community through the website extension of Team4her.</h4>

    <h3 class="projectTitle">Found</h3>
    <h4 class="gameDescription">Found is a game that I started making in Junior year for my APCSA class. It was meant to
      be an aim trainer that tested your name, but it evolved into a shooting game consisting of little red balls that
      you have to shoot to move on to the next level. It is a starter game that I don't know if I'll finish.</h4>
